          I was born in Ely, NV. I grew up in Spring Creek/Elko, NV. I live in
          Ogden, UT right now.
          <br />
          I have two kids, both boys. One is 13 and the other is 3. I am
          married, my wife and I are high school sweethearts.
          <br />
          I used to play drums in a band. If I could replay a fun moment in my
          life it would be playing concerts.
